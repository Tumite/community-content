## Introduction
Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

**Prerequisites**  

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need an Ubuntu 18.04 server with:

* at least 1GB of RAM

* 10 GB+ of drive space

* a `jenkins` user with sudo privileges

## Step 1 - Create jenkins user and Installing Docker & Docker-Compose

First of all we need a `jenkins` user with sudo privileges.
```bash
useradd jenkins
```
After you create jenkins user with your own password we can grant privileges.
```bash
usemod -aG sudo jenkins
```
From now we can use `jenkins` user:
```bash
su jenkins
```
Docker is an application that simplifies the process of managing application processes in containers. Containers let you run your applications in resource-isolated processes.

You can install up-to-date Docker by typing:

```bash
sudo curl -L https://get.docker.com | bash
```

You can check Docker version by running the following command:

```bash
sudo docker --version
```

Optionally you can add jenkins user to the "docker" group will grant the ability to run whitout sudo, with usermod -aG docker jenkins command

On Linux, you can download the Docker Compose binary from the [Compose repository release page on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases).

Please check first if have new version of docker-compose, now we use 1.25.0:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

To install a different version of Compose, substitute 1.25.0 with the version of Compose you want to use.

Apply executable permissions to the binary:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

You can check Docker version by running the following command:

```bash
sudo docker-compose --version
```

With these dependencies in place, weâ€™re ready to install R.

## Step 2 - Installing Jenkisn with Docker-Compose

First we need to make a local jenkins data directory for the image datas:

```bash
mkdir jenkins-data

mkdir jenkins_home
```
`Now we at /home/jenkins/jenkins-data`

Now we can start creating the docker-compose.yml file:

  

	version: '3'
	services:
	  jenkins:
	    container_name: jenkins
	    image: jenkins/jenkins
	    ports:
	      - "8080:8080"
	    volumes:
	      - $PWD/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home
	    networks:
	      - net
	networks:
	  net:

Before we create the Jenkins container we need to set correct permission to `jenkins_home` directory, because the container uses the id 1000 to write data.

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 jenkins_home/
```

Now we can spin up Jenkins container:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

We can see running containers by typing:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

Now you can check on your ip address or your domain with 8080 port and before use you need to unlock jenkins. Your unlock key you can find at docker container logs:

```bash
docker logs -f jenkins
```

  
	
	Jenkins initial setup is required. An admin user has been created and a password generated.

	Please use the following password to proceed to installation:

	  

	48c87b6106b44a20xxxx3ea80a0f9d10

	  

	This may also be found at: /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

  
`This is your unlock key: 48c87b6106b44a20xxxx3ea80a0f9d10`

Now you have a dockerized Jenkins. You only need to create you first Admin user in your browser and you can use it.
  
## Conclusion

By following this tutorial you have successfully installed Jenkins with docker.
