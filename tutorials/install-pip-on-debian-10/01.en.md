## Introduction

Pip is a package management system that allows you to install Python packages. With `pip`, you can install packages from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) and other repositories.

In this guide, we will explain how to install `pip` for both Python 2 pip and Python 3 `pip3` on Debian 10.

**Prerequisites**

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need a Debian 10 server with:

⋅⋅* a non-root user with sudo privileges

## Step 1.1 Installing pip for Python 3

First run the update command to update the package manager cache:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install `pip` for Python 3 and all of its dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
You can confirm that you have installed `pip` correctly by running the following command:

```bash
pip3 --version
```

## Step 1.2 Installing pip for Python 2

First run the update command to update the package manager cache:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install pip for Python 2 and all of its dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install python-pip
```
You can confirm that you have installed `pip` correctly by running the following command:

```bash
pip --version
```

## Step 2 Using Pip


If you want to install a python module globally, you should prefer to install it as a package using the `apt` manager. Use `pip` to install python modules globally only if there is no package available.

Usually, you would use pip inside a virtual environment only. Python [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/venv.html) allows you to install Python modules in an isolated location for a specific project, rather than being installed globally. This way you do not have to worry about affecting other Python projects.


Let’s try to install a package named urllib3:

```bash
pip install urllib3
```

Uninstalling a package:

```bash
pip uninstall package_name
```

Searching packages from PyPI:

```bash
pip search "search_query"
```

Listing installed packages:

```bash
pip list
```



## Conclusion

You should now have `pip` installed and ready to use on your system.
