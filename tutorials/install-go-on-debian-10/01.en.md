## Introduction


Go is a Google Developed modern open-source programming language. Go also known as Golang and offers a robust set of libraries. Popular applications like Docker, Grafana etc. are written in Golang. In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to install Go on Debian 10 and to build a simple real-world application.


**Prerequisites**

  

Following things are required:

- a non-root user with `sudo` privileges

  

## Step 1 - Downloading Go

  
First run the update command to update the package manager cache:

 
```bash
sudo apt update
```
  The current latest version of Golang available on the official website is `1.13` at the time writing this tutorial. You can get the current latest version URL by visiting their [download page](https://golang.org/dl/).

```bash
curl -O https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

##  Step 2 — Installing Go

  We'll now extract the downloaded archive and install it.

```bash
tar xvf go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

> **Note:**  Although  `/usr/local/go`  is the officially-recommended location, some users may prefer or require different paths.

  I am installing it under `/usr/local` directory. You can also put this under the home directory (for shared hosting) or other location.

```bash
sudo chown -R root:root ./go
sudo mv go /usr/local
```

### Step 2.1 -  Setting Go Paths
  
Now you should set PATH in order to find Go executable binaries by the system.

```bash
nano ~/.profile
```
And paste following lines inside it:
```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/work
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

> If you chose a different installation location for Go, then you should
> add the following lines to this file **instead** of the lines shown
> above.
> 
> ```bash
> export GOROOT=$HOME/go
> export GOPATH=$HOME/work
> export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin

Now save and exit the file then reload the profile running below command:
```bash
source ~/.profile
```

##  Step 3 — Test the Installation

Confirm and verify the go installation:
```bash
go version
```

> go version go1.13 linux/amd64

Create a new directory for go workspace:
```bash
mkdir $HOME/work
```
 Now create `src` directory inside it:
  ```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/work/src/hello
```

Next, you can create a traditional “Hello World” Go file:
```bash
sudo nano ~/work/src/hello/hello.go
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, World\n")
}
```
When it runs, this program will print `Hello, World`, indicating that Go programs are compiling correctly.

Now go to your `src` directory and install it:
```bash
cd ~/work/src
go install hello
```
With the program compiled, you can run it by executing the command:
```bash
hello
```

> Hello, World


## Conclusion

Now that you have downloaded and installed Go your Debian machine, you can start working on your Go projects.
